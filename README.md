# BluetoothCameraAndroid
A simple project to access camera bluetooth live feed.

## In case you've applied to Blink and you get this as an assignment, I'd recommend not to copy the code. Yes, its surprising that they still give this out as a task, but its kind of cool as an integrity check as well ;) If you do find it and end up using it, mention it in the credits of the submission, and you should be fine :D. As for the rest, please, be my guest!
